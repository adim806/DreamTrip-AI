# Server-Side Data Handling Implementation

## Overview

We've moved the external data fetching logic from the client to the server for improved security and flexibility. This change:

1. Protects API keys by keeping them on the server
2. Enables more powerful server-side libraries for data processing
3. Maintains the same data flow in the application
4. Centralizes external API calls for better monitoring and rate limiting

## Changes Made

### Backend Changes

1. Added new endpoints to handle external data requests:

   - `/api/external/weather` - Weather data from OpenWeatherMap
   - `/api/external/hotels` - Hotel recommendations using Google Places API
   - `/api/external/attractions` - Attraction recommendations using Google Places API
   - `/api/external/restaurants` - Restaurant recommendations using Google Places API
   - `/api/external/data` - Generic endpoint that routes to the appropriate service

2. Implemented server-side logic for:
   - Parameter validation
   - API calls to external services
   - Data formatting and error handling

### Frontend Changes

1. Updated the client-side services to call our server endpoints instead of external APIs directly:

   - Removed all direct API calls and API keys from client code
   - Maintained the same function signatures to ensure compatibility with the rest of the application
   - Added error handling for server communication

2. Set up environment variable for API base URL:
   - `VITE_API_URL` for the client to know where to find the server

## Required Environment Variables

Add these to your server's `.env` file:

```
# MongoDB Connection
MONGO=mongodb://localhost:27017/dreamtrip

# Client URL for CORS
CLIENT_URL=http://localhost:5173

# External API Keys (safely stored server-side)
GOOGLE_PLACES_API_KEY=your_google_places_api_key
OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=your_openweather_api_key
```

## Frontend Environment Variables

Add this to your client's `.env` file:

```
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

## Next Steps

1. **Testing**: Test all data services to ensure they work properly through the server
2. **Error Handling**: Improve error handling and add retries for more resilience
3. **Caching**: Implement server-side caching to reduce external API calls
4. **Rate Limiting**: Add rate limiting to protect against excessive API usage
5. **Move More Services**: Consider moving other external services (flights, events, etc.) to the server

## Benefits

- **Security**: API keys are no longer exposed in client-side code
- **Flexibility**: Server can use more powerful libraries and features
- **Performance**: Potential for server-side caching to reduce API calls
- **Maintainability**: Centralized data fetching logic is easier to update
- **Cost Control**: Better monitoring and control of external API usage
